# Flipkart Web Scraper

This is a Python-based web scraper that scrapes product data(here, smart phones under 50000) from Flipkart, an Indian e-commerce website. The scraper uses the Beautiful Soup library to parse the HTML content of the website and extract relevant information such as product names, prices, ratings, and reviews. The scraped data is then saved to a CSV file and transferred to an Excel file for easier analysis.
